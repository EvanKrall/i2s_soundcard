# i2s_soundcard

This repo is part of my larger [put an SBC inside an original iPad](https://hackaday.io/project/177256).
The goal of this component is to translate the PCM/I2S input/output of the Raspberry Pi CM4 to the iPad's headphone jack and internal speakers.
(And possibly the line-out pins on the 30-pin connector.)

Eventually this may end up on a single board with the other parts of the project, but for now this will be a separate board that surrounds the [touchscreen controller](https://github.com/EvanKrall/ipad_touchscreen_driver).
